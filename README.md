# Sticker Sales Forecasting - Kaggle 2025 Playground

## Overview  

This project is part of the 2025 Kaggle Playground Series, where participants forecast sticker sales in different countries. Kaggle competitions provide interesting and approachable datasets for the community to practice machine learning skills, with a new challenge each month.

This repository contains four notebooks covering different approaches to forecasting:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Initial data exploration and visualization.

- Forecasting without a Model: A rule-based forecasting approach using statistical techniques.

- LGBM + Optuna: A LightGBM model with hyperparameter tuning using Optuna.

- LGBM per Category: Individual LightGBM models trained for each category separately.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering using pandas and NumPy

- Implementation of multiple forecasting techniques

- Application of statistical methods and ML models

- Engineering lag features, rolling features, applying a sliding window approach, and recursive one-step-ahead forecasting

- Evaluation of forecasting performance using key metrics like MAE and RMSE
